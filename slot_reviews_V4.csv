1-31W,3-stars or below,,P.O.S. Its a fraud! If you actually want to get some cash the only app i have found is Justplay they actual paid me around 50bucks but the longer you have it the less they pay. But still vetter then this joke I wanted the 7 days andnnow it says there to many qurrants for my payment and I am 9987 in line..... As if. What a lie don't download it.
1-31W,3-stars or below,Numerical,Got to play maybe an hour before payouts got changed and ended up with nothin. All of a sudden my free spins and bonuses disappeared. Huh. Uninstalled

1-31W,3-stars or below,Positive,I didn't like it but you may?!
1-31W,3-stars or below,Numerical,Terrible game. Absolutely do not ever bet over 20K. I just went over 800 spins without a bonus or free spins. Don't give me any bs saying it's all random. You have these set to pay out for awhile to get you hooked then stop paying and stop giving out free spins and bonuses. I'm uninstalling this garbage.
1-31W,3-stars or below,Positive,February 1st 2022 I'm going into the game then ill come back give my results before I public anything
1-31W,3-stars or below,Positive,Terrible slots

1-31W,3-stars or below,Positive,YOU SUCK.
1-31W,3-stars or below,Technician Issues,I don't want to run. How long I have to wait
1-24W,3-stars or below,Technician Issues,Can't even in joy the game cuz you can't get it to download. It takes to long so sad
1-24W,3-stars or below,Advertising,"TONS of ads to watch... One every two spins! ZERO PAY!!! Regardless of how long you play this game, you won't be paid for your time and play! Delete this app if you have it and don't waste any more of your time!"

1-24W,3-stars or below,Technician Issues,"I enjoy the game, but it continues to drop off an I have to reload. This has happe ed at least 12 times within 4 hours."
1-24W,3-stars or below,Technician Issues,"I really want to play this game, but, I was can only get 2 or 3 spins in before the game shuts down. Reloaded 3 times so far. I'm going to give it 1 more try. I hope it works."
1-24W,3-stars or below,Positive,"Another hyped up game, but all lies."
1-24W,3-stars or below,Numerical,Have gained a lot at the beginning then after it is necessary to pack.
1-24W,3-stars or below,Technician Issues,"Lots of potential but very low payouts when you increase your bets and every game we played FROZE UP, maybe they'll fix all their issues and make it so one enjoy it. I Uninstalled it, too many issues and bottom of the barrel payouts"
1-24W,3-stars or below,Positive,Sucked
1-24W,3-stars or below,Numerical,They need to remame this game to Losin Cash Casino. No wins here. Move along folks.... Move along. Don't waste your time or money on these loser greedy no win games.
1-24W,3-stars or below,Technician Issues,"It won't load, too slow takes up too much data."
1-24W,3-stars or below,Positive,First things first. The game does have great graphics and everything else but the downside to it is when you win money and there's a glitch. They'll say we're sorry for the glitch here's some coins for your trouble but it doesn't equal up to the coins that you actually won. This game would have got a lot higher score if they would have just fixed it the right way.
1-24W,3-stars or below,Technician Issues,Does not give your points. Crash all the time.

1-17W,3-stars or below,Numerical,"It has a lot of potential to be a good game, but we all know that if you don't bet big, you don't win big, and that's no fun. They make sure that you start losing after you bet big. I had plenty of chips until I started betting bigger. Then I started losing. Not keeping an app where I lose, so good luck"

1-10W,3-stars or below,Advertising,"Lots of ads, very annoying. Can't even win a contest because ads pop up during game play. Also very annoying. Don't always receive messenger bonus and support claims it's my internet connection I live half a block away from a cell phone tower. Still no solution, excuses, excuses, and oh yeah excuses. Not very good at solving problems, but great at taking your money Still haven't won a ""Grand Jackpot"" either. I've had other apps less time, and won more. Maybe other apps aren't so bad."

12-06W,4-stars or above,Positive,"The game is alright, but it is slow to give credits. Otherwise I would recommend it to everyone."

12-06W,4-stars or above,Positive,A lot of fun !
12-06W,3-stars or below,Numerical,"Great graphics, variety of games, terrible payouts, spin way to much to get progressive spins, don't waste time or money."
12-06W,3-stars or below,Numerical,"Made 750M in first hour - after that I couldnt buy a decent bonus and it sucked it back in 5min. Classic. The games and graphics are standard at best. 1.5 Stars is what I'm giving it. Itd be much higher if there werent a ton of other slots waaaaay better. Some slots you dont mind throwing money at, this isnt one of them - hell even without spending money youll probably end up uninstalling. #ThumbsDown #Uninstalled."
12-06W,3-stars or below,Numerical,"If I could have zero stars, because with over 4 trillion coins it can't even be cleared or something bigger in gain will be uninstalled immediately !!!!!"
12-06W,3-stars or below,Numerical,"It was pretty good until about level 300 - now at level 345 it became very boring. As in real Vegas, if you stop winning, you go/switch to another Casino ... so I'm out"
12-06W,3-stars or below,Numerical,"The graphics and playability are at their best, but with bonuses and winnings on bets from 15-30 million, it couldn't be worse. In 4 hours of the game, I couldn’t even get to 1 billion, stupidly gobbled up all the coins without recoil. And 8 devices no win-win returns at all. For advertising, they give a minuscule amount for which it will not even be promoted to the normal denomination. Someone may like it, but not me, so fix it for the better there and see if it's worth the candle."
12-06W,3-stars or below,Numerical,All rating stars above 1 are fake !!! When the house wins everything it is no longer a game of chance or luck it is a crooked game of FRAUD !!!!!!!
12-06W,3-stars or below,Technician Issues,Installed .. it crashes ... it warms my cell ... Go shit
12-06W,3-stars or below,Numerical,"The selection of the games are great, great graphics. The reason I decided to give it two stars is because the winnings suck. I had over 1m coins and after reaching level 100, lost it all because the winnings don't come close to the bet amount. They want you to purchase coins, why would I do that, just to lose it all again."

11-29W,3-stars or below,Positive,What a tremendous waste of time
11-29W,3-stars or below,Advertising,To many adds
11-22W,3-stars or below,Advertising,The slots component is very well done and quite enjoyable to play. What really undermines the experience is the constant barrage of advertising and pops ups - many of which make it almost impossible to get back to the game. Many ads deliberately obfuscate the exit process so you end up being pushed onto Google play in an attempt to force you to install unnecessary apps. I played for a two weeks and then uninstalled for the above reason.
11-22W,3-stars or below,Technician Issues,Would not load
11-22W,3-stars or below,Advertising,Too many game interupting ads. Horrible

11-22W,3-stars or below,Technician Issues,Won't load. Connection failed while updating resources. No way to play.
11-22W,3-stars or below,Numerical,"Um. The scams are correct, at first they went wild, then they bite wildly, the stored value bite is bigger, and a small amount of money will give you medicine. no need to thank me."
11-22W,3-stars or below,Numerical,"I gave this game 5 stars, then it went to 3 stars. Now it's 1 star. I have played this game for 3 days. Spent 100.00 and can tell you this game is just boring. 1000 spins without 1 bonus game. Scatters are non-existent. And the payouts are pathetic. The game is a total ripoff. And it will screw you out of any money you put into it. I uninstalled it with a 2 bill balance. You monkeys can keep it. I wipe my arse you you. This game is very predictable. And is nothing but a massive disappointment"
11-15W,3-stars or below,Advertising,"I understand your need for ads but do they really need to be so prevalent? It seems near enough any action or spin or screen change triggers one. Again and again and again. Please, calm down the ad frenzy just a little bit, it makes for a near unplayable experience. I have uninstalled your app, the 'ad attack' has simply ruined it for me."
11-15W,3-stars or below,Numerical,"I changed my 5 stars to 1. All the slots are rigged, they are trying their hardest to getting your money and thats fine if you have fun for a little while but if you pay then your chances are getting less. Overall scammy slots app like every others."

11-15W,3-stars or below,Numerical,"Really good at first,but...one 2 occasions i did not win anything on 2 bonuses,done pretty good at first when buying but soon that didnt even work,they do not play fair,so if you want to waste money on a ""game"" they will be more than glad to keep on taking it..."

I must have watched 5 or more ads before even entering a game, 1st spin and yet another ad and when I left that game, yes yet another ad. In the end I quit altogether. No wonder I only play once awhile. I come away feeling more frustrated than relaxed!! And before you the developer says ads are needed so people can enjoy the game don't bother as people buy coins as well. A couple of ads are acceptable sure"
,4-stars or above,Advertising,There are so many pop up ads it takes forever just to start playing and they don't stop once you finally get to a slot machine. The ads actually interrupt your spins. It's crazy ridiculous. I'm uninstalling.

,4-stars or above,Numerical,DON'T waste your time or money purchasing coins for this game because they rarely let you hit the jackpot or bonus games you would think it's a game you play for fun but really it's about how much money they can make and get out of you They get you to spend real money and you lose all coins purchased within 2 minutes.... Impossible to level up.... This app is bulls**t
